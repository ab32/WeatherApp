# Getting Started
We will go through the process of downloading the weather application and making it work. First off you need to download **main.py** and then **api.key**. The main.py file contains all of the backend and frontend development of the weather app. The api.key file contains my personal api-key from my account on **https://openweathermap.org/**. 

When finished donwloading the two files, create a python folder in your preferred IDE. I would recommend **PyCharm**, because I used it. Delete the automatically created **main.py** from the folder, copy both **main.py** and  **api.key** git files into this newly created folder.

The last step and the most important one. I'm using a python library called **Requests** in order to get this package you need to follow the instructions below if you are using **PyCharm**.

1. go to setting from File in menu
2. next search for Python interpreter
3. click on the + button
4. search for requests package and install it

You can also use the terminal in **PyCharm**, just follow the instructions below.

In the terminal/command-line:

  * pip install requests 

then use it inside your Python script by:

  * import requests
